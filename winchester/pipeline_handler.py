       Pipeline handlers perform the actual processing on a set of events
       captured by a stream. The handlers are chained together, each handler
       in a pipeline is called in order, and receives the output of the previous
       handler.

       Once all of the handlers in a pipeline have successfully processed the
       events (with .handle_events() ), each handler's .commit() method will be
       called. If any handler in the chain raises an exception, processing of
       events will stop, and each handler's .rollback() method will be called."""

            the next handler's .handle_events() method. Handlers can add new
            events simply by adding them to the list they return. New events
            (those with unrecognized message_id's), will be saved to the
            database if all handlers in this pipeline complete successfully.
            Likewise, handlers can omit events from the list they return to
            act as a filter for downstream handlers.

            this method. Pipelines can be re-tried if a handler throws an
            error. If you need to perform such operations, such as interacting
            with an external system, save the needed information in an instance
